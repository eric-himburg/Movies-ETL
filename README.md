# Movies ETL
## Overview of the Project
In this project data was gathered from both Wikipedia and Kaggle, combine them, and save them into a SQL database so that the hackathon participants have a nice, clean dataset to use. To do this, she will follow the ETL process: extract the Wikipedia and Kaggle data from their respective files, transform the datasets by cleaning them up and joining them together, and load the cleaned dataset into a SQL database.
The idea behind ETL is straightforward. Raw data exists in multiple places and needs to be cleaned and structured before it can be analyzed. ETL breaks this problem into three steps, or phases: Extract, Transform, and Load.
